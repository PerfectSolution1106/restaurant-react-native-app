# Restaurant App
Fully-fledged React Native restaurant app. I used *local* json-server to fetch and post the data with Redux. I also used **Expo** componets and APIs suchs as ImagePicker, Camera, Calendar etc to bring native functionalites to the app.

## Main Dependencies
- Redux (with redux-thunk and redux-persist)
- expo
- react-native-animatable
- react-navigation

## Technologies/Tools
